# Coopelia-Based-Adaptive-Headlight-
This project demonstrates an autonomous headlight rotator using sensors to detect obstacles and adapt the light direction accordingly. The system can navigate through an environment and ensure maximum visibility in the required direction, making it ideal for robotics and vehicle applications.
